# beanhub-import [![CircleCI](https://dl.circleci.com/status-badge/img/gh/LaunchPlatform/beanhub-import/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://dl.circleci.com/status-badge/redirect/gh/LaunchPlatform/beanhub-import/tree/master)

Beanhub-import is a simple, declarative, smart, and easy-to-use library for importing extracted transactions from [beanhub-extract](https://github.com/LaunchPlatform/beanhub-extract).
It generates Beancount transactions based on predefined rules.

Read the [documentations here](https://beanhub-import-docs.beanhub.io/).

**Note**: This project is still in early stage, still subject to rapid major changes

Please also checkout our blog posts about the BeanHub Import and BeanHub Connect features based on this tool:
- [BeanHub Import - One small step closer to fully automating transaction importing](https://beanhub.io/blog/2024/05/27/introduction-of-beanhub-import/)
- [BeanHub Connect - one giant leap with fully automatic bank transactions import from 12,000+ financial institutions in 17 countries for all Beancount users!](https://beanhub.io/blog/2024/06/24/introduction-of-beanhub-connect/)

## Features

- **Easy-to-use** - you only need to know a little bit about YAML and Jinja2 template syntax.
- **Simple declarative rules** - A single import file for all imports
- **Idempotent** - As long as the input data and rules are the same, the Beancount files will be the same.
- **Auto-update existing transactions** - When you update the rules or data, corresponding Beancount transactions will be updated automatically. 
- **Auto-move transactions to a different file** - When you change the rules to output the transactions to a different file, it will automatically remove the old ones and add the new ones for you
- **Merge data from multiple files (coming soon)** - You can define rules to match transactions from multiple sources for generating your transactions

For example, change the import rules like this to output transactions to files grouped by quarter instead of year:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/LaunchPlatform/beanhub-import/raw/master/assets/quater-output-file.png?raw=true" alt="Git diff screenshot showing default_file changed to output quater file names instead of just year" />
</p>

Then run the import again, and you will get this:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/LaunchPlatform/beanhub-import/raw/master/assets/auto-txn-migration.png?raw=true" alt="Git diff screenshot showing Beancount transactions removed from the books/2024.bean file and new quater beancount files added" />
</p>

Another example is when you want to add new tags to the generated transactions, so you change the rules with new tags like this:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/LaunchPlatform/beanhub-import/raw/master/assets/new-tags.png?raw=true" alt="Git diff screenshot showing new line" />
</p>

When you run import again, you will get this:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/LaunchPlatform/beanhub-import/raw/master/assets/new-tags-result.png?raw=true" alt="Git diff screenshot showing new tags added to all imported Beancount transactions" />
</p>

Please check out our demonstration repository [beanhub-import-demo](https://github.com/LaunchPlatform/beanhub-import-demo) to try it yourself.

It's all declarative and idempotent. With beanhub-import, you say goodbye to manually importing and maintaining transactions!
We hope you like this tool. It's still in the early stage of development.
We are also working on making generating transactions from multiple sources possible.
Please feel free to open issues in the repository if you have any feedback ðŸ™Œ

## Why?

There are countless Beancount importer projects out there, so why do we have to build a new one from the ground up?
We are building a new one with a completely new design because we cannot find an importer that meets our requirements for [BeanHub](https://beanhub.io).
There are a few critical problems we saw in the existing Beancount importers:

- Need to write Python code to make it work
- Doesn't handle duplication problem
- Hard to reuse because extracting logic is coupled with generating logic
- Hard to customize for our own needs
- Can only handle a single source file

## Example

The rules of beanhub-import is defined in YAML format at `.beanhub/imports.yaml`. Here's an example

```YAML
# the `context` defines global variables to be referenced in the Jinja2 template for
# generating transactions
context:
  routine_expenses:
    "Amazon Web Services":
      account: Expenses:Engineering:Servers:AWS
    Netlify:
      account: Expenses:Engineering:ServiceSubscription
    Mailchimp:
      account: Expenses:Marketing:ServiceSubscription
    Circleci:
      account: Expenses:Engineering:ServiceSubscription
    Adobe:
      account: Expenses:Design:ServiceSubscription

      account: Expenses:Engineering:ServiceSubscription
    Microsoft:
      account: Expenses:Office:Supplies:SoftwareAsService
      narration: "Microsoft 365 Apps for Business Subscription"
    Mercury IO Cashback:
      account: Expenses:CreditCardCashback
      narration: "Mercury IO Cashback"
    WeWork:
      account: Expenses:Office
      narration: "Virtual mailing address service fee from WeWork"

# the `inputs` defines which files to import, what type of beanhub-extract extractor to use,
# and other configurations, such as `prepend_postings` or default values for generating
# a transaction
inputs:
  - match: "import-data/mercury/*.csv"
    config:
      # use `mercury` extractor for extracting transactions from the input file

      # postings to prepend for all transactions generated from this input file
      prepend_postings:

            number: "{{ amount }}"

    actions:
      # ignore action is a special type of import rule action to tell the importer to ignore the
      # transaction so that it won't show up in the "unprocessed" section in the import result
      - type: ignore

```

## Usage

This project is a library and not meant for end-users.
If you simply want to import transactions from CSV into their beancount files, please checkout the `import` command of [beanhub-cli](https://github.com/LaunchPlatform/beanhub-cli).
