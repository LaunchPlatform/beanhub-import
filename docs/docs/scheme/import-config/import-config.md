# Import Config

The following keys are available for the import configuration:

- `name`: An optional name for the user to comment on this matching rule. Currently, it has no functional purpose.
- `match`: The rule for matching raw transactions extracted from the input CSV files. As described in the Import Match Rule Definition
- `actions`: Decide what to do with the matched raw transactions, as the Import Action Definition describes.
