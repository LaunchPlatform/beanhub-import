### Unique import id for transactions extracted from the CSV files

The biggest challenge we face when designing this system is finding a way to deduplicate the
imported transactions from CSV.
Obviously, we need a way to tell which transactions were already imported into Beancount
files so that we don't need to import them again. To make this happen, we introduce the concept
of `import-id`.
Each transaction extracted from CSV files should have a unique import ID for us to identify.

In this way, we can process the existing Beancount files and find out which transactions
have already been imported.
We add a metadata item with the key `import-id` to the transaction.

Here's an example:

```
2024-04-15 * "Circleci"
  import-id: "<unique import id>"
  Assets:Bank:US:MyBank                              -30.00 USD
  Expenses:Engineering:ServiceSubscription            30.00 USD
```

The next question will then be: What should be the unique ID for identifying each transaction
in the CSV files?
If the CSV files come with an ID column that already has a unique value, we can surely use it.
However, what if there's no such value in the file? As we observed, most CSV files exported
from the bank come with rows ordered by date.

The straightforward idea is to use `filename + lineno` as the id. The Jinja2 template
would look like this:

```jinja2
{{ file }}:{{ lineno }}
```

Then with a transaction from row 123 in the file `import-data/mybank/2024.csv` should have
an import ID like this:

```
import-data/mybank/2024.csv:123
```

As most of the bank transactions export CSV files have transactions come in sorted order by
date, even if there are new transactions added and we export the CSV file for the same
bank again and overwrite the existing file, there will only be new lines added at the bottom of the file.


The line number of older transactions from the same CSV file with the same export time range and
filter settings should remain the same. The file name and line number serve as a decent default
unique identifier for the transactions from CSV files.

Although this approach works for most CSV files sorted by date in ascending order, it won't
work for files in descending order.
For example, CSV files exported from [Mercury](https://mercury.com/) came in descending order.
Obviously, any new transactions added to the export file will change the line number for all
previously imported transactions.
To overcome the problem, we also provide `reverse_lineno` attribute in the extracted transaction.
It's the `lineno - total_row_count` value. As you may have noticed, we intentionally made the
number negative.
It's trying to make it clear that this line (or row) number is in the reversed order, just
like Python's negative index for accessing elements from the end.

With that, we can define the import ID for Mercury CSV files like this:

```jinja2
{{ file }}:{{ reversed_lineno }}
```

Since each CSV file may have its own unique best way to reliably identify a transaction,each class of extractor can define its own default import ID template.

```
class YourExtractor(ExtractorBase):

    def get_import_id_template(self) -> str:
        return "{{ file }}:{{ reversed_lineno }}"
```
